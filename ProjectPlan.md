# pinetime_plus

A project to add the ability to integrate the
3 axis accelerometer activity so that it
can be analyzed by python packages such as
pyActigraphy and agcounts.

Here is the repository for the InfiniTime which is the PineTime Firmware

https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime/tree/main

Phases

1. Analysis of code, how to change the accelerometer sampling to 30 Hz
2. Store the data for later upload
3. Approach to upload the accelerometer data using a python desktop application
